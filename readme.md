# Trade - Hytale mod

This is my first mod ever, please be kind <3

## Description

This mod adds trading functionality to the game Hytale, allowing players to exchange items with other players.

## Command

To open the trading panel, use the following command:

```
/trade <playerName>
```

## Notes

*   You must be within 5 blocks of the other player to start a trade.
*   Only items in your inventory can be traded (**hotbar excluded**).
*   Only **full slots** are tradable. To trade a specific quantity, you must first split them into a separate stack.

## Why?

This mod was created to allow players to exchange items securely without the risk of theft.
